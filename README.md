# vim-password-store
Vim niceties for password store ("pass" the standard Unix Password Manager)

This is a fairly straight-forward fork of Tom Ryder's password-store plugin,
included in the contrib folder for pass and at Tom's cgit store:
https://git.zx2c4.com/password-store/

I've added some niceties based around a fuller filetype implementation,
in particular

* unset spell
* add simple syntax highlighting
